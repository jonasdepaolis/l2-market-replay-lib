        Trading agent implementation.

        The backtest iterates over a set of sources and alerts the trading agent
        whenever a source is updated. These updates are conveyed through method
        calls to, all of which you are expected to implement yourself: 

        - on_quote(self, market_id, book_state)
        - on_trade(self, market_id, trade_state)
        - on_time(self, timestamp, timestamp_next)
        
        In order to interact with a market, the trading agent needs to use the 
        market_interface instance available at `self.market_interface` that 
        provides the following methods to create and delete orders waiting to 
        be executed against the respective market's order book: 

        - submit_order(self, market_id, side, quantity, limit=None)
        - cancel_order(self, order)

        Besides, the market_interface implements a set of attributes that may 
        be used to monitor trading agent performance: 

        - exposure (per market)
        - pnl_realized (per market)
        - pnl_unrealized (per market)
        - exposure_total
        - pnl_realized_total
        - pnl_unrealized_total
        - exposure_left
        - transaction_costs

        The agent may also access attributes of related class instances, using 
        the container attributes: 

        - order_list -> [<Order>, *]
        - trade_list -> [<Trade>, *]
        - market_state_list -> {<market_id>: <Market>, *}

        For more information, you may list all attributes and methods as well
        as access the docstrings available in the base class using
        `dir(BaseAgent)` and `help(BaseAgent.<method>)`, respectively.
